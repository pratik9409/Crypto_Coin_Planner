The Crypto Coin Planner project is a Python-based application designed to help investors keep track of their cryptocurrency investments. The project is built using several key technologies including API integration, web scraping, tkinter, and JSON.

The first step of the project is to fetch data from various cryptocurrency websites using API keys. This data is then converted into the required form and organized to provide users with a clear view of their investment performance. The data includes information such as the previous 24-hour and 7-day values, as well as recent updates on the market.

Once the data is collected, the application organizes it and compares it to the investments made by the user. This allows for a clear view of profit and loss over time. The system tracks the number of coins or the amount invested, and compares it to current market values.

The Crypto Coin Planner is designed with a user-friendly interface that makes it easy for investors to track their cryptocurrency portfolios. The application allows users to enter their investments, and the system will automatically keep track of their performance. Users can view their portfolio information and see how their investments are performing in real-time.

The project also includes a web scraping component, which allows the system to collect data from cryptocurrency websites that do not provide an API. This ensures that users have access to the most up-to-date and accurate information possible.

The project is built using tkinter, a Python library that allows for the creation of graphical user interfaces. This makes it easy for investors to navigate the application and view their portfolio information.

Overall, the Crypto Coin Planner is a valuable tool for cryptocurrency investors. The system allows for easy tracking of investments and provides real-time information on profit and loss. The use of API integration, web scraping, and tkinter ensure that the system is accurate, up-to-date, and user-friendly.
